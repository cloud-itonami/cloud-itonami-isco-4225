  "Audit entries for the ISCO-08 4225 community inquiry-desk actor.

  Measured on 0abfc59, before this namespace existed. Two runs — one an
  automatic `:answer-inquiry` and one a `:publish-faq` that interrupted
  at `:request-approval` and was resumed through `actor/approve!` —
  produced entries of the same shape:

    {:disposition :commit :record {...}}
    {:disposition :commit :record {...}}

  Keys `(:disposition :record)` both times. The README says
  `:publish-faq` — external publication — ALWAYS requires human
  sign-off, and the ledger could not show that any given write had
  received it. The distinction survived only in the op name, which is
  the payload, not the authorisation. An audit trail whose entries do
  not record what authorised the write cannot answer the one question
  it is kept for.

  So an entry names its `:authorisation` and this namespace refuses to
  build one without it:

    :governor-clear  the governor returned :ok? true; no human involved.
    :human-sign-off  the run interrupted at :request-approval and a
                     human resumed the thread. The act of resuming IS
                     the approval, so it is recorded as one.
    :governor-hold   the governor refused; nothing was committed.

  `entry` is total and pure: it either returns a well-formed entry or
  throws, and it never reaches a store. Building an entry is not
  appending one.")
